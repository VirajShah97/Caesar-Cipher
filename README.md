# Caesar Cipher
The shift_alpha() function takes in the entire English alphabet list and a shift value. It gives out an output string with the encrypted alphabet list. Strings have been encrypted and decrypted using the encrypt() and decrypt() functions respectively. Similar to the shift_alpha() function, the encrypt function also takes in the unencrypted string along with the value with which the string must be encrypted whereas the decrypt function takes in an encrypted message and spits out 26 combinations with the shift in the range of [-12,13].
